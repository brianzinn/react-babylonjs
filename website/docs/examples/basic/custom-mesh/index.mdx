title: 'Custom Mesh'
---

We're not just limited to basic shapes here, but the real purpose of this
example is to highlight 2 custom properties:

```tsx
<mesh name="mesh" fromInstance={customMesh} disposeInstanceOnUnmount>
  ...
</mesh>
```

When you supply a `fromInstance` prop then the renderer will substibute what you
provide instead of "newing up" that object for you. You can do this with
Cameras, Textures, etc. Property changes will flow to that instance as usual.

The renderer will not dispose of this instance when it unmounts the Component,
but you can opt-in by specifying that you would like that done on your behalf.
In our case it's a bit simple - we could have in a useEffect disposed the mesh,
but in some cases you may have something like a texture map that you want
re-used and whenever you use `fromInstance` the renderer will assume you are
managing the lifecycle of that object unless you request automatic disposal with
`disposeInstanceOnUnmount` (which is the same as
`disposeInstanceOnUnmount={true}`)
