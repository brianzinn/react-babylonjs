# Animations Example

Animations can be done directly with Scene.BeginAnimation. Especially for
looping ones this is much more efficient that going into an animation or render
loop to update the values manually.

This also lets you set Easing functions, etc.

The main takeaway here as a concept though is that the Spheres that are being
created are automatically parented to their parent mesh (TransformNode). That's
why the animation can be applied to a single mesh! NOTE: there is currently no
opt-out mechanism for parenting.
