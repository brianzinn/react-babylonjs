title: 'Edges Rendering'
---

This is an example of EdgesRendering. You need to import for side-effects and
then run a method on the mesh once the mesh has been created.

`onCreated` is available for all objects created and gives you direct access as
an escape hatch whenever you want to do something imperatively.
