# Importing

If you are using 3D models ensure you have added the `@babylonjs/loaders` NPM.
It is not a direct dependency, but registers loaders as plugins via imports with
side effects:

- Register **all** model types `import @babylonjs/loaders;`
- OBJ `import '@babylonjs/loaders/OBJ';`
- glTF `import '@babylonjs/loaders/glTF';`
