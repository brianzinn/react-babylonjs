title: '2D GUI'
---

2D GUI example that shows how a modal dialog could work and also in a scenario
that will work in XR/VR.

NOTE: a full screen GUI does not work in VR, but a GUI on a `Plane` does - you
can supply the prop `createForParentMesh` on the ADT:

```tsx
<plane ...>
  <advancedDynamicTexture
    createForParentMesh
    ...
  >
   ...
  </advancedDynamicTexture>
</plane>
```

Click on one of the boxes to trigger the GUI modal:

<code src="./2d-gui/With2DUI.tsx" />
