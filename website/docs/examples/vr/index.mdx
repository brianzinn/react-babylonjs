This shows the original way to triggeer the VR experience. This has been
superceded by the XR (VR + AR) - will update this once XR is working on apple
devices.

Click on ICO spheres to rotate ghettoblaster model
(clockwise/counter-clockwise).

## In VR mode

Use your hand-held controls to click ICO spheres and teleport by clicking on the
ground.
