title: 'PBR Configuration'

Click the button to toggle the PBRClearCoatConfiguration roughness between 0
and 1. Note that the Clear Coat Configuration is already part of the PBR, so we
are just declaratively attaching to it and the renderer is able update the
values via state changes to props.

The prop `assignFrom` is used to connect an existing property.
