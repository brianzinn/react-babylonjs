There is currently no declarative way to have `addMesh` called on your behalf,
but you can do so by capturing the references:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (highlightLayerEL.current && sphereRef.current) {
    highlightLayerEL.current.addMesh(sphereRef.current, Color3.Green())
  }
}, [sphereRef, highlightLayerEL])
```

<code src="./HighlightLayer.tsx" />
