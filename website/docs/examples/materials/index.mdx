title: 'Extending materials'

This shows how to dynamically register a separate library like
`@babylonjs/materials`.

You can make any component you want available declaratively to the renderer in
this manner. Choose a different color from the dropdown and the renderer sets
the `lineColor` prop of GridMaterial.

<code src="./Materials.tsx" />
