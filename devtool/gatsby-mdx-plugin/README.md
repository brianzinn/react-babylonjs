# gatsby-mdx-codesandbox

`[code:HelloWorld.tsx]` will prettify and inline the code for the file named
`HelloWorld.tsx` in the same directory as your `mdx` file.

`[demo:HelloWorld.tsx]` will show a Codesandbox iframe using the template you
have specified. When running on localhost, it will also show run the component
locally, presumably using local packages.
