title: 'Context Bridge'

These can be used to bring context across renderer boundaries.

In `react-babylonjs` that will be on the Engine and Scene components. So,
capture (Consumer) the context outside and "Provide" inside the Scene.

Example is given here - you would need these for Themes or libraries like Redux
that depend on context. If you are using Redux and your project is not too far
along consider switching to a state management library that doesn't suffer from
this issue such as Zustand.
