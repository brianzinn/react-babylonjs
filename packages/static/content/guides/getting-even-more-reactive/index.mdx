In the last section, we made a cool spinning box, but we cheated a little bit.
Inside the `MovingBox` component, we had this:

```jsx
useBeforeRender(() => {
  if (!boxRef.current?.rotation) return
  if (!scene) return
  const deltaTimeInMillis = scene.getEngine().getDeltaTime()
  boxRef.current.rotation.y +=
    (RPM / 60) * Math.PI * 2 * (deltaTimeInMillis / 1000)
})
```

In particular, the `boxRef` and
`boxRef.current.rotation.y += (RPM / 60) * Math.PI * 2 * (deltaTimeInMillis / 1000)`
create what we call a _bad smell_. It's not necessarily wrong, and it might even
be right, but it's good to take a look.

One of the main principles of React is to maintain state and let those state
changes flow through to the components. By altering variables by reference, we
defeat one of the main principles of React.

There is a better way using `useState`.

```tsx
const [y, setY] = useState(0)
useBeforeRender(() => {
  if (!scene) return
  const deltaTimeInMillis = scene.getEngine().getDeltaTime()
  setY((y) => y + (RPM / 60) * Math.PI * 2 * (deltaTimeInMillis / 1000))
})
```

Putting it all together, here is a `StatefulMovingBox` demo:

Why is this better? For a small example like this, it may not be obvious. In a
larger application, programming via state management instead of imperitively
changing variables means you can easily affect changes across multiple
components simply by altering the state.

Consider how easy it is to add a second box, with zero new logic in your render
handler::

```tsx
<box name="box" size={2} position={new Vector3(-2, 1, 0)} rotation={new Vector3(0, y, 0)} />
<box name="box" size={2} position={new Vector3(2, 1, 0)} rotation={new Vector3(0, y, 0)} />
```
