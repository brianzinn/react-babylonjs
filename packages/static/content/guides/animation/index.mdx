title: 'Declarative Animation'
---

Programming declarative animation is a huge topic, but we'll scratch the surface
in this guide.

# The declarative animation loop

`react-babylonjs` acheives animation via an animation loop that executes around
60 times per second. You can hook into this loop by using the `useBeforeRender`
hook. As its name implies, it is called before each frame render and allows you
to adjust whatever needs adjusting.

The beauty of declarative programming is that each React component can register
its own animation loop handler and take responsibility just for its small task.
Tasks in common can be hoisted to parent components. In this way, we can achieve
very efficient and organized animations.

Here's some basic usage:

```tsx
const scene = useScene()

useBeforeRender(() => {
  if (!scene) return
  // This gets called about 60 FPS
  // Don't do a lot in here, just essentials
})
```

# Degrees of Freedom

Every object in 3D has a _position_ (x, y, z) in space and a _rotation_ (roll,
pitch, yaw). As
[google states it](https://developers.google.com/vr/discover/degrees-of-freedom):

> Three correspond to rotational movement around the x, y, and z axes, commonly
> termed pitch, yaw, and roll. The other three correspond to translational
> movement along those axes, which can be thought of as moving forward or
> backward, moving left or right, and moving up or down.

You can read a lot about this elsewhere, so we won't cover it in much depth
here. The main point to take away is that animation involves affecting one or
more of these degrees of freedom on each object.

In `react-babylonjs`, we use `useBeforeRender` to adjust these properties.

# Creating the famous rotating box

Let's use a box as an example. We will rotate it about the Y axis, known as
_yaw_. And, we'll do it many times per second.

Here's how to make a box:

```tsx
<box name="box" size={2} position={v3(0, 1, 0)} />
```

[devtool:LoneBox.tsx]

That was the easy part. The hard part is making it spin. We will make the box
spin about the Y axis. From
[Mesh rotation in Babylon](https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/mesh/transforms/center_origin/rotation)
we see that the Y axis is the vertical axis.

To achieve animation, we have to alter the box's Y rotation. Ok, let's do it.
First, we need a state variable to hold the Y value:

```tsx
const [y, setY] = useState(0)
```

Then, we need to alter it in the animation loop:

```tsx
useBeforeRender(() => {
  setY((oldY) => oldY + 0.1)
})
```

To put everything together, we can create a High Order Component that wraps the
`box` tag with our new behaviors.

```tsx
import { v3 } from '@react-babylonjs/extra'
import React, { FC, useState } from 'react'
import { useBeforeRender } from 'react-babylonjs'

const RotatingBox: FC = () => {
  const [y, setY] = useState(0)
  useBeforeRender(() => {
    setY((oldY) => oldY + 0.1)
  })
  return (
    <box name="box" size={2} position={v3(0, 1, 0)} rotation={v3(0, y, 0)} />
  )
}
```

[devtool:BasicScene.tsx]

# Using real-world timing in animations

The rotatin box is fun, but it would be nice to specify its rotation speed in
term so of real-world time.

Let's adjust the rotation to Revolutions Per Minute (RPM). To do that, we need
to know that one complete revolution of _yaw_ is `pi \* 2`.

We also need to know how many milliseconds have passed between animation frames.
Fortunately Babylon.js provides a `getDeltaTime()` that tells us exactly that.
Using all that information, we can do this instead:

```tsx
const RPM = 5
setY((oldY) => oldY + (RPM / 60) * Math.PI * 2 * (deltaTimeInMillis / 1000))
```

[devtool:RPMBoxRaw.tsx]

# Making `rpm` a component property

Let's use the power of Typescript to create some spinning box props that accepts
RPM:

```tsx
type RotatingBoxProps = {
  rpm: number
}
```

This will be the props that we pass to the box. Let's update the box component
to use it:

```tsx
const RotatingBox: FC<RotatingBoxProps> = ({ rpm }) => ...
```

And then update the hook:

```tsx
useBeforeRender(() => {
  // ...
  setY((oldY) => oldY + (rpm / 60) * Math.PI * 2 * (deltaTimeInMillis / 1000))
})
```

Now that's a nice reactive component! We use it like this:

```tsx
<RotatingBox rpm={60} />
```

Let's try it. We should see one rotation per second when `RPM === 60`.

[devtool:RPMBox.tsx]

# Adding default props

It's a little silly to require `rpm={60}` just to use the box. Let's make a
sensible default for it by using `Partial` so the prop is optional, and
assigning a default value:

```tsx
const RotatingBox: FC<Partial<RotatingBoxProps>> = (props) => {
  // This is my personal technique. I accept a Partial<Props> on the way
  // in, then I create a _props containing the defaults merged with whatever
  // has come in
  const _props: RotatingBoxProps = {
    rpm: 5,
    ...props,
  }
  const { rpm } = _props
  // ...
}
```

[devtool:RPMBox2.tsx]

# Making `rpm` even more reactive

In the interests of completeness, you might notice the hook is referring to
`rpm`. If `rpm` were to change, we would want to make sure that new value took
effect. Therefore, just like `useEffect`, `rpm` is a dependency:

```tsx
useBeforeRender(
  () => {
    // ...
  },
  undefined,
  undefined,
  undefined,
  [rpm]
)
```

[devtool:RPMBox3.tsx]

# Added to `extra`

And of course, you can get this `RotatingBox` from `extra`.

```tsx
import { RotatingBox } from '@react-babylonjs/extra'
;<RotatingBox />
```

[devtool:RPMBoxFromExtra.tsx]

# Adding a debugging experience

It would be very cool if we had a way to interact with the application state for
debugging purposes.

There are a couple ways to accomplish this:

1. Outside the scene, using standard web technologies
2. Inside the scene, using a GUI capable of rendering in 3D space

Let's go with option #1 for now.
