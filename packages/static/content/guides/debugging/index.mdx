title: 'Debugging'

It would be very cool if we had a way to interact with the application state for
debugging purposes.

There are a couple ways to accomplish this:

1. Outside the scene, using standard web technologies
2. Inside the scene, using a GUI capable of rendering in 3D space

Let's go with option #1 for now..

NOTE: this devtool is turned off as it fails the build. switch to use Inspector?
devtool:Debug.tsx
