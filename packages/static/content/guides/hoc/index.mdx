We've been able to do some pretty cool reactive stuff so far. But to go farther,
we need to talk about High Order Components and how they apply to your 3D
programming.

Consider the basic `box` tag:

```tsx
<box
  name="box"
  size={2}
  position={new Vector3(0, 1, 0)}
  rotation={new Vector3(0, 1, 0)}
/>
```

There are a few bad smells to explore.

1. The `name` field has to be specified every time, even though we may not care
   what the name is.
2. The `Vector3` parameter is in a fairly unusable object format. It's good for
   3D programming, but not for reactive programming.

We can fix both of these issues with a little imagination. Here especially we
begin to see the power of Typescript.

## Creating an HOC (High Order Component)

First, let's create a React component to wrap the `box` tag. We'll call it
`Box`.

```tsx
const Box: FC = () => {
  return (
    <box
      name="box"
      size={2}
      position={new Vector3(0, 1, 0)}
      rotation={new Vector3(0, 1, 0)}
    />
  )
}
```

## Fixing the `name` problem

Now we can begin adding other conveniences. For example, suppose we want each
box to have a globally unique ID by default. Easy!

Here's a simple technique to generated unlimited guids. Every time `mkGuid()` is
called, it returns a new value like `g1234`.

```tsx
const mkGuid = (() => {
  let i = 0
  return () => `g${++i}`
})()
```

Now we can modify our `Box` component appropriately:

```tsx
const Box: FC = () => {
  const [guid, setGuid] = useState(mkGuid())

  return (
    <box
      name={guid}
      size={2}
      position={new Vector3(0, 1, 0)}
      rotation={new Vector3(0, 1, 0)}
    />
  )
}
```

That will keep the same guid for that `Box` instance as long as it exists.

But actually, that has a bad smell too. Here is a better approach that decouples
and simplifies the use of guids in components.

```tsx
const useGuid = () => {
  const [guid, setGuid] = useState(mkGuid())
  return guid
}

const Box: FC = () => {
  const guid = useGuid()

  return (
    <box
      name={guid}
      size={2}
      position={new Vector3(0, 1, 0)}
      rotation={new Vector3(0, 1, 0)}
    />
  )
}
```

## Fixing the `Vector3` problem

The `Vector3` problem will really bother any experienced React programmer. It
uses an opaque object that makes state management very difficult. In an ideal
world, we want to be able to pass a state tree into components. Here's an
idealized format for `x`, `y`, `z` coordinates.

The benefits of Typescript are becoming more clear because it allows us to
describe state structures in a strongly typed manner.

```tsx
type Vector3Struct = {
  x: number
  y: number
  z: number
}
```

Since `box` takes a `Vector3` object, a way to map from the struct to the object
would be helpful:

```tsx
type StructToVector3 = (struct: Vector3Struct) => Vector3

const structToVector3: StructToVector3 = ({ x, y, z }) => new Vector3(x, y, z)
```

That's it. Just a wrapper that creates a new `Vector3` from the struct.

We can make it a little better by accepting defaults so we can do something like
`structToVector3({x: 4})`. This way, we're not depending on `Vector3`'s
underlying behavior. I didn't even check to see what it does if `undefined` is
passed. It might default to `0` but it might not. This way we don't need to
worry and being explicit doesn't incur any extra overhead.

```tsx
type StructToVector3 = (struct: Partial<Vector3Struct>) => Vector3

const structToVector3: StructToVector3 = ({ x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 }) =>
  new Vector3(x, y, z)
```

We could also create a helper to map a struct to an existing `Vector3`. We will
make it possible to specify partials just like before. The `Vector3` object is
so inexpensive that modifying vs creating probably doesn't matter. But if it
did, and if we knew enough JavaScript kung fu, we could be a badass and do this:

```tsx
type ApplyStructToVector3 = (
  struct: Partial<Vector3Struct>,
  vector: Vector3
) => Vector3

const applyStructTOVector3: ApplyStructToVector3 = (struct, vector) =>
  Object.assign(vector, struct)
```

And it would be very fast in every modern JavaScript engine (particulary Node).

Now let's figure out how to get that all into the `Box` component. To do that,
we need to create `BoxProps`:

```tsx
type BoxProps = {
  position: Vector3Struct
  rotation: Vector3Struct
}
const Box: FC<BoxProps> = (props) => {
  const guid = useGuid()
  const { position, rotation } = props

  return (
    <box
      name={guid}
      size={2}
      position={structToVector3(position)}
      rotation={structToVector3(rotation)}
    />
  )
}
```

[devtool:BoxHoc.tsx]

Whew! That's a lot to cover. Now we have a pretty useful `Box` component. You
can see why we call it High Order. It's doing a lot of grunt work for us.

But it wouldn't be complete to stop here. To really understand HOC, let's see
how we'd alter the `StatefulMovingBox`.

Recall we left off here:

```tsx
const StatefulMovingBox: FC = () => {
  const scene = useScene()
  const [y, setY] = useState(0)

  useBeforeRender(() => {
    if (!scene) return
    const deltaTimeInMillis = scene.getEngine().getDeltaTime()
    setY((y) => y + (RPM / 60) * Math.PI * 2 * (deltaTimeInMillis / 1000))
  })

  return (
    <box
      name="box"
      size={2}
      position={new Vector3(0, 1, 0)}
      rotation={new Vector3(0, y, 0)}
    />
  )
}
```

If we swap `box` for `Box`, we get something like this:

[devtool:StatefulMovingBox.tsx]
