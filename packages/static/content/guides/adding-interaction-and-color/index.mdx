title: 'Adding More Interaction and Color'
---

Let's take a look at how to spice up this scene a bit, so that it has some color
and user interaction (hover and click).

Here's the standard imperative way to add color to a box. There are many
materials and different color properties (diffuse, emissive, etc)

```typescript
import { Color3, MeshBuilder, StandardMaterial } from '@babylonjs/core'

const box = MeshBuilder.CreateBox('box', { size: 2 }, scene)
const material = new StandardMaterial('material', scene)
material.diffuseColor = Color3.Yellow()
material.specularColor = Color3.Black()
box.material = material
```

```tsx
<box name="box" size={2}>
  <standardMaterial
    name="material"
    diffuseColor={Color3.Yellow()}
    specularColor={Color3.Black()}
  />
</box>
```

If you have followed the other guides the declarative should be obvious. The
main thing to note is that the material is automatically assigned. When the
material is created is walks down the tree graph and assigns itself to the first
mesh it finds. You can also put Texture objects as children of the
`<standardMaterial .. />` there is more on that later.

# Adding interactions

We'll do that with hooks for hover (useHover) and click (useClick).

Basically both of those hooks are pretty self explanatory in the sense that they
have a callback methods:

1. useClick: has a single callback for when a click occurs
2. useHover: callbacks for for hovering `over` and `out` events.

If you don't pass in a `Ref` then one will be created for you (and you can use
that in the object). The easiest way though is to use a `useRef` and pass it
through to each hook - check the code below demonstrates that way to flow the
ref through.
