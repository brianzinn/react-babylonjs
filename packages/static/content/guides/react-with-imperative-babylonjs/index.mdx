Once you have a React project set up, you can add Babylon.js imperatively by
connecting it to a canvas element. This page shows a vanilla JS way with zero
dependencies and a library that makes that easier.

Skip this page to go to using `react-babylonjs` directly.

There is more explanation here:
[official Babylon.js + React guide](https://doc.babylonjs.com/extensions/Babylon.js+ExternalLibraries/BabylonJS_and_ReactJS).

[devtool:FullImperative.tsx]

The demo above is produced using imperative Typescript. With ~150 lines of code
you have a box spinning on your screen! It's better to bring in a library though
as it has other features and fixes common issues. We'll be going afterwards into
the advantages of using the `react-babylonjs` renderer.

As you review the code, notice everything happens in sequence and you are
responsible for re-running affected code when you change the input values.

In [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming), a
change in the application state naturally cascades to affected code. There are
many benefits to a reactive programming style that we won't cover here. But
speed, efficiency, and ability to reason through complex state changes are among
the many benefits.

The imperative coding also makes it more difficult to decompose your
application.

Therefore, the sample above - while it _does_ run in the React framework - it is
not the author's preferred way to use Babylon.js with React.

If you do want to stick with just a simple Component that will setup a canvas
and provide a callback when the scene is ready, there is another helpful package
[babylonjs-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babylonjs-hook) which has the
`SceneComponent` from previous example (adds some hooks and better resize
events, etc.) and is available on NPM. The `onSceneReady` handler provided is
still imperative programming though. We can reduce the line count to ~60 lines
of code, but all we've done is move part of it into a 3rd party package. The
approach is still fundamentally the same: It's still imperative programming, not
declarative or reactive programming.

Here is the same example using the `babylonjs-hook` package:

[devtool:WithHooks.tsx]

In summary, this guide has shown you how to use imperative programming within
React. Let's move on to declarative programming and how the `react-babylonjs`
renderer can help us develop with Babylon.js using a familiar declarative
paradigm with hooks/state/refs/etc..
