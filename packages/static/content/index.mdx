**react-babylonjs** integrates the Babylon.js real time 3D engine with React.

`react-babylonjs` lets you build 3D and XR scenes and games using reactive
programming, reusable components, and hooks.

The Babylon.js API is mostly covered declaratively thanks to code generation and
even custom props allow you to declaratively add shadows, physics, 3D models,
attach 2D/3D UI to meshes, etc.

Fully supports hooks. Full support for TypeScript with auto-completion on
elements and compile time checks. Context API and hooks provide easy access to
Scene/Engine/Canvas.
