In the last section, we made a cool spinning box, but we cheated a little bit.
Inside the `MovingBox` component, we had this:

```jsx
useBeforeRender(() => {
  if (!boxRef.current?.rotation) return
  if (!scene) return
  const deltaTimeInMillis = scene.getEngine().getDeltaTime()
  boxRef.current.rotation.y +=
    (RPM / 60) * Math.PI * 2 * (deltaTimeInMillis / 1000)
})
```

In particular, the `boxRef` and
`boxRef.current.rotation.y += (RPM / 60) * Math.PI * 2 * (deltaTimeInMillis / 1000)`
create what we call a _bad smell_. It's not necessarily wrong, and it might even
be right, but it's good to take a look.

One of the main principles of React is to maintain state and let those state
changes flow through to the components. By altering variables by reference, we
defeat one of the main principles of React.

Instead, let's make a `StatefulMovingBox` by using `useState` to track the `y`
value from before:

```tsx
const StatefulMovingBox: FC = () => {
  // access Babylon Scene
  const scene = useScene()
  const [y, setY] = useState(0)
  // access refs to Babylon objects in scene like DOM nodes

  useBeforeRender(() => {
    if (!scene) return
    const deltaTimeInMillis = scene.getEngine().getDeltaTime()
    setY((y) => y + (RPM / 60) * Math.PI * 2 * (deltaTimeInMillis / 1000))
  })

  return (
    <box
      name="box"
      size={2}
      position={new Vector3(0, 1, 0)}
      rotation={new Vector3(0, y, 0)}
    />
  )
}
```
