# Breaking Changes

- 0.x to 1.0 ([List](breaking-changes-0.x-to-1.0.md))
- 1.x to 2.0 - Change NPMs from `babylonjs-*` to `@babylonjs/*`. 'Engine' not passed into onSceneMount(e) parameter - use e.scene.getEngine(). Suggest switching to intrinsic elements (camelCase instead of ProperCase).
- 2.x to 3.0 ([List](breaking-changes-2.x-to-3.0.md))

Full list of all NPM versions and commit logs starting with 2.2.2 (August 2020) is integrated with github releases:

Anything before that would require manually going through repo history.
