# React BabylonJS

> 'react-babylonjs' 3.x has many breaking changes to advance the API decided to
> do them all at once in a major version.

## hostInstance not public

**BEFORE:**

```jsx
conse boxRef = useRef();
if (boxRef.current) {
  const mesh = boxRef.current.hostInstance;
}
...
<box ref={boxRef} .../>
```

**AFTER:** Now is directly accessible

```jsx
conse boxRef = useRef();
if (boxRef.current) {
  const mesh = boxRef.current;
}
...
<box ref={boxRef} .../>
```

## model -> Model

`model` intrinsic host element has been removed in favour of a `Model` component
(notice the lower case vs. proper case), which needs to be enclosed in
`React.Suspense` Component. **BEFORE:**

```jsx
import { Scene } from 'react-babylonjs';
...
<Engine>
  <Scene>
    <model ... />
  </Scene>
</Engine>
```

**AFTER:** Now needs to be enclosed in Suspense and **must explicitly import the
loader** for side-effects. Additionally, the `onModelLoaded` signature doesn't
include a SceneContext, but you can get scene from any `mesh._scene`.

```jsx
import React, {Suspense} from 'react';
import { Engine, Scene } from 'react-babylonjs';
import '@babylonjs/loaders'; // This is IMPORTANT and was not needed before!!

...
<Engine>
  <Scene>
    <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
      <Model ... />
    </Suspense>
  </Scene>
</Engine>
```

_NOTE_: If you are only using OBJ then you can reduce your registrations to
`import '@babylonjs/loaders/OBJ';`. Similarly for glTF:
`import '@babylonjs/loaders/glTF';`

## Hooks renamed `useBabylonScene` -> `useScene`, `useBabylonEngine` -> `useEngine` & `useBabylonCanvas` --> `useCanvas`

`model` intrinsic host element has been removed in favour of a `Model` component
(notice the lower case vs. proper case), which needs to be enclosed in
`React.Suspense` Component. **BEFORE:**

```jsx
import { useBabylonScene, useBabylonEngine, useBabylonCanvas } from 'react-babylonjs';
...
```

**AFTER:** different names

```jsx
import { useScene, useEngine, useCanvas } from 'react-babylonjs';
...
```

# `fromInstance` declared objects to not automatically dispose, but you can opt-in.

Typical scenario when using `fromInstance` is that you would want to re-use the
mesh multiple times. If you load a texture then you would expect it to be
re-used when you pass it `fromInstance`. That may not be the case often with
meshes, so you need to declare disposing. This is a breaking change in that if
you were expecting that behaviour that the object would no longer be disposed.
**BEFORE:**

```jsx
import { Vector3, Color3, MeshBuilder } from '@babylonjs/core'

const [mesh, setMesh] = useState(null)
const scene = useScene()
useMemo(() => {
  console.log('creating a box with scene', scene)
  setMesh(MeshBuilder.CreateBox('test', { size: 1 }, scene))
}, [])

return (
  <>
    {mesh && (
      <mesh
        name="box"
        fromInstance={mesh}
        rotation={props.rotation}
        disposeInstanceOnUnmount
      >
        <standardMaterial
          name="boxmat"
          diffuseColor={Color3.Blue()}
          specularColor={Color3.Black()}
        />
      </mesh>
    )}
  </>
)
```

**AFTER:** Must include `disposeInstanceOnUnmount` to work as before. We need to
explicitly declare our intention when we hand off an instance.

```jsx
import { Vector3, Color3, MeshBuilder } from '@babylonjs/core'

const [mesh, setMesh] = useState(null)
const scene = useScene()
useMemo(() => {
  console.log('creating a box with scene', scene)
  setMesh(MeshBuilder.CreateBox('test', { size: 1 }, scene))
}, [])

return (
  <>
    {mesh && (
      <mesh
        name="box"
        fromInstance={mesh}
        rotation={props.rotation}
        disposeInstanceOnUnmount
      >
        <standardMaterial
          name="boxmat"
          diffuseColor={Color3.Blue()}
          specularColor={Color3.Black()}
        />
      </mesh>
    )}
  </>
)
```

If you find something else that changed for the migration, please add a PR or
create an issue. Thanks.
